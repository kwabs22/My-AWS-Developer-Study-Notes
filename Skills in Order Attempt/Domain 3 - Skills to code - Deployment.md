***Domain 3: Deployment
Task Statement 1: Prepare application artifacts to be deployed to AWS.
Skills in:***

# Managing the dependencies of the code module (for example, environment variables, configuration files, container images) within the package

# Organizing files and a directory structure for application deployment

# Using code repositories in deployment environments

# Applying application requirements for resources (for example, memory, cores)

Task Statement 2: Test applications in development environments.
Skills in:

# Testing deployed code by using AWS services and tools

# Performing mock integration for APIs and resolving integration dependencies

# Testing applications by using development endpoints (for example, configuring stages in Amazon API Gateway)

# Deploying application stack updates to existing environments (for example, deploying an AWS SAM template to a different staging environment)

Task Statement 3: Automate deployment testing.
Skills in:

# Creating application test events (for example, JSON payloads for testing Lambda, API Gateway, AWS SAM resources)

# Deploying API resources to various environments

# Creating application environments that use approved versions for integration testing (for example, Lambda aliases, container image tags, AWS Amplify branches, AWS Copilot environments)

# Implementing and deploying infrastructure as code (IaC) templates (for example, AWS SAM templates, AWS CloudFormation templates)

# Managing environments in individual AWS services (for example, differentiating between development, test, and production in API Gateway)

Task Statement 4: Deploy code by using AWS CI/CD services.
Skills in:

# Updating existing IaC templates (for example, AWS SAM templates, CloudFormation templates)

# Managing application environments by using AWS services

# Deploying an application version by using deployment strategies

# Committing code to a repository to invoke build, test, and deployment actions

# Using orchestrated workflows to deploy code to different environments

# Performing application rollbacks by using existing deployment strategies

# Using labels and branches for version and release management

# Using existing runtime configurations to create dynamic deployments (for example, using staging variables from API Gateway in Lambda functions)
